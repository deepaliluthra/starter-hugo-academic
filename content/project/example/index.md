Studied the role of Ca2+ and Ca2+-binding proteins in host-pathogen interactions of Pseudomonas aeruginosa with lung epithelial cells (adenocarcinoma alveolar basal epithelial A549 cells and CuFi-5 bronchus lung epithelial cells CuFi-5, with homozygous F508 mutation as in CFTR protein in cystic fibrosis).
* Studied Ca2+ stimulated upregulation of adherence, invasion, intracellular survival and escape of P. aeruginosa strains and its clinical isolates during infection.
* Trancriptomics analysis conducted (RNA-seq and RT-qPCR) to study the expression of virulence genes during infection and its significance in Cystic Fibrosis.
* Studied the abundance of P. aeruginosa proteins and signaling molecules affected during adherence and invasion of epithelial cells.
* Screened Cystic Fibrosis clinical isolates for P. aeruginosa, followed by testing virulence (biofilm forma- tion, antimicrobial resistance against antibiotics) and the effect of Ca2+ on virulence of P. aeruginosa (reactive oxygen species generation, cytotoxicity to epithelial cells, flagella of P. aeruginosa).
* Roles and responsibilities included but not limited to handling cell culture and blood-borne pathogens, planning and conducting experiments, documenting standard operating procedures (SOP) and material safety data sheets (MSDS) in compliance with EHS.
